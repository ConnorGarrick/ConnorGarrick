Hello, I'm @ConnorGarrick. Thanks for visiting my profile!
I am interested in learning new programming languages and improving my current coding skills.
The languages I currently know are Java, Python, C, and C++, and I have experience with C#, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
I plan on working with embedded systems in the future, so look out for new projects related to that area!
I would love to collaborate on projects that use languages such as Java, C++, and Python.
Please reach me through my email at connor.garrick03@gmail.com or message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-garrick/
Thanks!
