Hello, I'm @ConnorGarrick. Thanks for visiting my profile!
I am interested learning new programming languages, as well as improve my current coding skills.
The languages I currently know are Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
I am planning on learning languages such as Rust and C, so look out for new projects in those languages!
I would love to collaborate on projects that use languages such as Java, C#, Python, and HTML.
Please reach me through my email at connor.garrick03@gmail.com or message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-garrick/
Thanks!
